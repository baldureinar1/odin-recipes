    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound bacon, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy cream, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>16 ounces dry fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped parsley</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook and stir bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat together eggs and cream in a medium bowl until just blended. Stir in Parmesan cheese and set aside.</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook pasta in boiling water until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and return pasta to the pot.</li>
        <li>Add softened butter to the pot and toss with pasta until butter is melted. Add bacon and egg-cheese mixture. Stir until the heat of pasta cooks eggs, then garnish with parsley and black pepper to serve.</li>
    </ol>
